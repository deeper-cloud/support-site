# How to view data graphs

A way to view your data in a visually engaging format.

### Deeper BI's analytics are divided into two categories displayed on the upper-right side of the screen: 
- Overview
- Explore
{% callout type="" %}
Below those categories, the blue button allows you to view the current date relevant to the displayed data. You can manually go back and forth between days by tapping the arrows on each end, or alternate between presets (today, yesterday, last week...) hours, days, weeks and months by tapping the button and selecting the date & time you would like to review. 
{% /callout %}

1. To toggle "Explore", simply select it.

2. To access different categorized data to review, simply tap the drop-down button labeled with the current graph title, located below "Analytics" on the upper-left corner of the screen. This will reveal additional options for you to choose from.

3. Further down the screen, there is a spreadsheet format of the data displayed in each graph.
