# How to assign subcategories to categories

Implement subcategories into categories for more effective communication between guests and staff, as well as a more detailed menu experience.  
1. Access Menu Engineering via Deeper Hub. 
 
2. Make sure the "Categories" tab is toggled on the upper-left side of the screen. 

3. Bottom-right of "New Category", tap the add symbol (+) next to "Subcategories". 

4. Select the subcategories you would like to add to your menu, either by selecting them manually or entering their name in the "Enter Search Value" bar. After locating the relevant category, tap to add it.

Subcategories essentially serve as categories that can be linked to one another, which is why they are synonymous with the "Category" section of menu engineering and are constructed similarly.
