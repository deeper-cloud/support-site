# How to create a new subcategory

Each category in a menu consists of subcategories applicable to the relevant category.

Subcategories are created the same way categories are- through the "Category" tab in Menu  Engineering. 


They are used to signify an item that has multiple variations, and allow you to select a customized preset of said item.

For example,
subcategory - "Burrata Salad"

Items: 25g Burrata Salad, 75g Burrata Salad
{%/callout %}


To create a new subcategory:

1. Access Menu Engineering via Deeper Hub. 
 
2. Toggle the "Categories" tab on the upper-left side of the screen. 

3. Tap the "Add New" button located on the upper-right side of the screen. 

4. Under "New Category", enter a valid name to identify the category by, and tap the add symbol (+) next to "Menu Items".

5. Select the menu items you would like to add to your category, either by selecting them manually or entering their name in the "Enter Search Value" bar. After locating the relevant item, tap to add it. 

You can re-order the items by holding down the left mouse button (or finger) on the 6 dots symbol left of each item's title and drag downwards/upwards depending on your preference. 

To erase an item from the menu, tap the trash-can icon, right of its title. 

5. When done, tap the "Save" button on the upper-right side of the screen to save.

6. Attach to relevant categories, as seen in [How to Create a New Category](/docs/nodes)
