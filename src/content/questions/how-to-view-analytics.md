# How to View Analytics Overview

### Deeper BI's analytics are divided into two categories displayed on the upper-right side of the screen: 
- Overview
- Explore

{% callout type="" %}
Below those categories, the blue button allows you to view the current date relevant to the displayed data. You can manually go back and forth between days by tapping the arrows on each end, or alternate between presets (today, yesterday, last week...) hours, days, weeks and months by tapping the button and selecting the date & time you would like to review. 
{% /callout %}

the overview automatically displays as you open "BI" through Deeper Hub, and includes 6 different metrics to evaluate your data:

1. Income + before VAT (Value Added Tax)
2. PPA - Per Person Average
3. Total orders + open orders
4. Tips +  subcategory below, displaying different payment methods used

5. Payment methods, with a choice to display by pie chart visual or spreadsheet format
6. Excluded payments (cancellations, discounts...)
