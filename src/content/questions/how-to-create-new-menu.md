# How to Create a New Menu

Each menu consists of a combination of categories applicable to the relevant menu.

To create a new menu:

1. Access Menu Engineering via Deeper Hub. 
 
2. Make sure the "Menus" tab is toggled on the upper-left side of the screen. 

3. Tap the "Add New" button located on the upper-right side of the screen. 

4. Under "New Menu", enter a valid name to identify the menu by, and tap the add symbol (+) next to "Categories". 

5. Select the categories you would like to add to your menu, either by selecting them manually or entering their name in the "Enter Search Value" bar. After locating the relevant category, tap to add it. 

You can re-order the categories by holding down the left mouse button (or finger) on the 6 dots symbol left of each category's title and drag downwards/upwards depending on your preference. 

To erase a category from the menu, tap the trash-can icon, right of the category's title. 

5. When done, tap the "Save" button on the upper-right side of the screen to save the menu you've created.
