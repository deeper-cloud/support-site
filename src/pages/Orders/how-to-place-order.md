# How to Place an Order
---
1.  On the menu screen of your POS, any unoccupied table is represented by a numbered, white square. Assign the appropriate table to the guests you are seating by tapping on its icon. 

2. When a pop-up screen appears, choose the number of guests who are seated at the selected table.

3. Add relevant menu items to your order. When done, tap the blue checkmark at the bottom-left of the screen to place your order.
